    <h5 class="project-job">Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, Tester</h5>
    I was originally assigned to work in a group to develop a party supply store web application using Python and Django. The plan was for us to collaborate on the full development cycle: gathering requirements, dividing tasks, designing the database schema, building out the product catalog, implementing user authentication, and creating a functional shopping cart system. We were supposed to use Git for version control so each team member could contribute to different parts of the project simultaneously. However, partway through the project my laptop broke, which disrupted our collaboration plan. Because I temporarily lost access to the shared tools we were using, I was not able to help out until the project was all but complete. I approached the teacher to explain what happened and asked to do the entire application on my own once I regained access to a working computer. This meant taking on all development responsibilities myself: setting up the Django environment, creating the models and views for products and orders, building the templates for the storefront, configuring the admin interface, and ensuring the site worked end-to-end. I also had to troubleshoot and test everything independently. While the situation wasn’t ideal, it pushed me to take full ownership of the project and demonstrated that I could manage both the backend and frontend aspects of a Django application under unexpected circumstances.
